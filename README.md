# ETL
ETL is an acronym that stands for Export, transform and load. This is a populr data engineer term which defines the process of extracting data from an external data storage(relational/non-relational), performing analytics on it to solve real world problems and then loading it back to the same or another data storage.The goal is to always transform the data from what it was orginally and loading it to a secured data warehouse. Lately this term has become synonymous with working with large datasets, using a progamming langauge to get data insights and loading the data into the cloud. 
In this project. I scraped the yahoo finance news page to collect trending stocks data, used the python pandas library to transform the data and loaded it up to a relational data storage on AWS.
